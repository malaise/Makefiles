This is a set of makefile templates for Ada and C compilation.

A makefile in the source is generally made of:
-------------------------------------
include $(HOME)/Makefiles/common.mk
# Other includes
# Definitions
include $(TEMPLATES)/ada.mk # or c.mk
-------------------------------------

The generation will make two directories, lib_Linux (for the objects) and 
bin_Linux (for the binaries) and create symlinks from bin_linux/* to .

List of templates:
common.mk : defines path to Makefiles and defines UNIX commands
path.mk   : defines paths to Ada, C, gnat and pcre
c.mk      : generation from C sources
ada.mk    : generation from Ada sources
units.mk  : define the list of current Ada units
dir.mk    : recursive make (through subdirectories)
git.mk    : generates a .gitignore
post.mk   : init and cleanup commands
